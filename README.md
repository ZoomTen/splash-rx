# Splash Rescues Friday RX
**Splash Rescues Friday RX** is a remake of an older game titled "*Ninja Splash Rescues Friday*"
a.k.a "*Ninja Splash Saves Friday*" by [Nyro Fletcher](http://tj-otter.deviantart.com) circa 2010.

The game is currently still a **work in progress**, though a demo has been released. Note that
many of the sprites haven't been finished, so a lot of them are currently placeholder sprites (or old sprites from the original game).

Also I decided to post the source on GitHub for no reason. Yum.

## Building the git version
* Install [**GameMaker:Studio**](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker), then download this repo as a zip
(or if you have git installed, run `git clone https://github.com/ZoomTen/splash-rx` on the Git Bash prompt)
* If downloaded as a zip, extract it somewhere easy to find.
* Open **GameMaker:Studio**, click on the "Open" tab, navigate to where you cloned/extracted the repo, then click on the gmx file.
* Specify the platform target (the game's currently optimized for PC's including Windows, Mac, Linux), then:
   1. **Just run** the game by clicking the green "play" button
   2. **Install/run** the game by going to File -> Create Application...

## "Release" Builds
The **official** builds can be downloaded [here](http://gamejolt.com/games/splash-rescues-friday-rx/163445). (Currently **Windows** and **Linux** builds are available, Mac build coming soon - use **Wine** in the meantime)
