/ SPLASH RESCUES FRIDAY RX (LINUX)   \
/ v.2.9.x                            \
/====================================\
 
Info:
   This is a (currently WIP) remake of an old platformer, "Ninja Splash Rescues
   Friday" made in around 2010.
   
   This remake will (hopefully) feature new enemies, new graphics, a more sensible
   plot, new music, and other stuff idk
   
   Before running the game, install the dependencies if you don't have them
   already, see the Dependencies below. Check your distro for equivalent packages.
   
   Make sure you install the 32-BIT (i386) libraries if you're on a 64-bit system!

   To run the game:
   
   - File managers: right click on the "SplashRX" file, click on Properties.
     Click the permissions tab, and set the SplashRX file as executable.
     Now double-click on "SplashRX", and if prompted click on "Execute".
     
   - Terminal: Navigate to where you unzipped the game, open any terminal
     emulator (XTerm, Gnome Terminal, Konsole etc.) and type in:
     
     "chmod +x SplashRX && ./SplashRX"

   There may be no audio output, most likely caused by OpenAL derping out.
   Add this line:
   
   "drivers = pulse,alsa,oss"
   
   to "/etc/openal/alsoft.conf". This might fix the problem. If it doesn't,
   look for other solutions or just use Wine to run the Windows version.
   
   If you're using JACK, sound effects may not be audible.
   
What this demo includes:
   - 3 worlds (Snort Forest, Lush Tropical, Winter Breeze) + 1 new world
     (Red Hot)
   - An original soundtrack
   - Save/load
   - A slightly buggy platform engine
   - Random items placed everywhere
   - Impeccable clipart, stock and placeholder sprites
   - Dialogue
   - Lives system
   - Other yummy stuff
   
What to expect in the next demos:
   - Actual plot
   - Redesigned everything
   - Less snakes
   - Less placeholders
   - snort
   
Controls:
   UP    = jump
   LEFT  = run left
   RIGHT = run right
   SPACE = shoot shuriken (if you have ammo)
   Q     = restart level
   Z     = continue text/select
   X     = skip text
   
Some nitpicky information you probably won't care:
   Version number's 2.9.x for now because this is the 2nd remake of the game.
   The first one came out a little snorty so yeah. The final release version
   will have the version number of 3.0.x.
