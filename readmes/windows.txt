/ SPLASH RESCUES FRIDAY RX (WINDOWS) \
/ v.2.9.x                            \
/====================================\
 
Info:
   This is a (currently WIP) remake of an old platformer, "Ninja Splash Rescues
   Friday" made in around 2010.
   
   This remake will (hopefully) feature new enemies, new graphics, a more sensible
   plot, new music, and other stuff idk
   
   This version will also run in Linux (and maybe Mac) under Wine (tested with
   version 1.9.14 dev, but it should hopefully work on stable version)
   
What this demo includes:
   - 3 worlds (Snort Forest, Lush Tropical, Winter Breeze) + 1 new world
     (Red Hot)
   - An original soundtrack
   - Save/load
   - A slightly buggy platform engine
   - Random items placed everywhere
   - Impeccable clipart, stock and placeholder sprites
   - Dialogue
   - Lives system
   - Other yummy stuff
   
What to expect in the next demos:
   - Actual plot
   - Redesigned everything
   - Less snakes
   - Less placeholders
   - snort
   
Controls:
   UP    = jump
   LEFT  = run left
   RIGHT = run right
   SPACE = shoot shuriken (if you have ammo)
   Q     = restart level
   Z     = continue text/select
   X     = skip text
   
Some nitpicky information you probably won't care:
   Version number's 2.9.x for now because this is the 2nd remake of the game.
   The first one came out a little snorty so yeah. The final release version
   will have the version number of 3.0.x.
